# Inheritance

 - One class copies the attributes and methods from another class.
 - The class that is being inherited from is called the parent class, and the class that inherits is called the child class.
 - The child class can also have its own attributes and methods, in addition to the ones it inherits from the parent class.
 - Inheritance promotes code reusability and can make it easier to create and maintain applications.
